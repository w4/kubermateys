Just a little collection of things I've made for k8s.

- [deluge](deluge) - separate daemon/UI containers built using Nix
- [git](git) - a cgit/git server with private repositories. who needs a full gitea instance anyway?
- [bin](resources/bin.yaml) - a k8s manifest to run [bin](https://github.com/w4/bin) without much extra thought
